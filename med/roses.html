            <sup>Roses Lyrics</sup>
            <p>
                [Verse 1] <br>
                Turn around, there's those eyes again <br>
                Turn around, fake indifference and I <br>
                Watch the cold, dark silhouettes disappear <br>
                A hundred bodies fill this room <br>
                And all their faces overdone <br>
                Pain is foreign, foreign to us
            </p>
            
            <p>
                [Chorus] <br>
                I don't even know you <br>
                You won't even know I'm gone <br>
                Was it something I did wrong? <br>
                [Post-Chorus] <br>
                Roses, roses cold <br>
                Roses, roses sold out
            </p>
            
            <p>
                [Verse 2] <br>
                Turn around, reds and whites again <br>
                I'd sell my kicks for one more low tar <br>
                Fevers hand-in-hand with shoelace bracelets <br>
                Why are some girls so naive? <br>
                He didn't unbutton your blouse to see <br>
                A better view of your heart, oh yeah, can't blame you for trying
            </p>
            
            <p>
                [Chorus] <br>
                I don't even know you <br>
                You won't even know I'm gone <br>
                Was it something I did wrong?
            </p>
            
            <p>
                [Post-Chorus] <br>
                Roses, roses cold <br>
                Roses, roses sold out <br>
                Roses, roses cold <br>
                Roses, roses sold out
            </p>
            
            <p>
                [Bridge] <br>
                Sing it soft, make it slow <br>
                Apples parachute the boys back down <br>
                Fill it up, overflow <br>
                A new improved modern way to feel
            </p>

            <p>
                [Chorus] <br>
                I don't even know you <br>
                You won't even know I'm gone <br>
                I don't even know you <br>
                You won't even know I'm gone
                
            </p>

            <p>
                [Outro] <br>
                Was it something I did wrong? <br>
                Was it something I did wrong? <br>
                Was it something I did wrong?
            </p>
