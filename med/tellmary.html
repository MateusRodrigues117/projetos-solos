                        <sup>Tell Mary Lyrics</sup>
                        [Verse 1] <br>
                        Oh, play along, she wills it <br>
                        Oh, Sunday came, promised you'd tell her <br>
                        She sat up in bed, answered your call dear <br>
                        Smeared purple and red
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        [Chorus] <br>
                        You're gonna leave her tonight <br>
                        She sat up with her eyes wide <br>
                        You fell in love with a girl you knew <br>
                        You've come to say goodbye <br>
                        You're gonna leave her tonight <br>
                        Under a cheap July sky <br>
                        Tell her, tell Mary
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        [Verse 2] <br>
                        After the first touch, her skirt boring <br>
                        Her voice deep and charming at first <br>
                        You could make her come back once in a while, if you painted a fresco <br>
                        There she'd be with her powder half falling off, so perfect from far
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        [Chorus] <br>
                        You're gonna leave her tonight <br>
                        She sat up with her eyes wide <br>
                        You fell in love with a girl you knew <br>
                        You've come to say goodbye <br>
                        You're gonna leave her tonight <br>
                        Under a cheap July sky <br>
                        Tell her, tell Mary <br>
                        Tell her, tell Mary
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        [Bridge] <br>
                        Meet me at the pictures, Mary <br>
                        Adam said that he was leaving <br>
                        Meet me at the pictures, Mary <br>
                        Adam said that he was leaving <br>
                        Meet me <br>
                        Meet me <br>
                        You're gonna leave her tonight
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        [Chorus] <br>
                        You're gonna leave her tonight <br>
                        She sat up with her eyes wide <br>
                        You fell in love with a girl you knew <br>
                        With a girl you knew <br>
                        You're gonna leave her tonight <br>
                        She sat up with her eyes open wide <br>
                        You fell in love with a girl you knew <br>
                        And you've come to say goodbye <br>
                        You're gonna leave her tonight <br>
                        Under a cheap July sky <br>
                        Tell her, tell Mary <br>
                        Tell her, tell Mary <br>
                        Tell her, tell Mary
