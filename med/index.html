                        <sup>Masterpiece Lyrics</sup> <br>
                        It's too bad you knew me <br>
                        When I wasn't ready <br>
                        And I wasn't ready <br>
                        Did I say, "Come and get me?" <br>
                        And too bad I held on <br>
                        When you tried to tell me <br>
                        This was wrong <br>
                        Well, is this wrong? <br>
                        I'm telling you, I am no masterpiece <br>
                        Where innocence is painted green <br>
                        And isn't it strange to think <br>
                        That you created all of me? <br>
                        It's done by the hands of a broken artist <br>
                        You painted black where my naked heart is <br>
                        I finally know what wrong is <br>
                        Now, I finally know that you bleed for nothing <br>
                        Carved like a stone with your hands still shaking <br>
                        On display though a soul still breaking <br>
                        Aren't you proud you're the one that made me? <br>
                        Aren't you proud you're the one that made me? <br>
                        You can't erase these <br>
                        Lines, you can't save me <br>
                        Oh, you can't display me <br>
                        Oh, oh, you know what dismay means <br>
                        I can't even try to <br>
                        Remember what I knew <br>
                        Before I became your <br>
                        Model, I claim no <br>
                        And so I am no masterpiece <br>
                        So strange that you made all of me <br>
                        Done by the hands of a broken artist <br>
                        You painted black where my naked heart is <br>
                        I finally know what wrong is <br>
                        Now, I finally know that you bleed for nothing <br>
                        Carved like a stone with your hands still shaking <br>
                        On display though a soul still breaking <br>
                        Aren't you proud you're the one that made me? <br>
                        Aren't you proud you're the one that made me? <br>
                        And I grew tired <br>
                        And you expired <br>
                        Oh, you finished me <br>
                        Now that I am all that you planned <br>
                        Well, tell me what do you think? <br>
                        Done by the hands of a broken artist <br>
                        You painted black where my naked heart is <br>
                        I finally know what wrong is <br>
                        Now, I finally know that you bleed for nothing <br>
                        Carved like a stone with your hands still shaking <br>
                        On display though a soul still breaking <br>
                        Aren't you proud you're the one that made me? <br>
                        Aren't you proud you're the one that made me? <br>
                        Too bad you knew me <br>
                        I wasn't ready <br>
                        I am no masterpiece at all
